# USAhousing-price-prediction
Regression analysis for USA Housing is to predict the price of houses.
The main focus of this regression analysis for USA Housing is to compare and evaluate the performance of three different regression models - linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression - to find out which model is better for a given data set.

The choice between linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data. Linear regression models work best when the relationship between the input features and the target variable is linear and the number of input features is small. Decision tree and random forest models work best when the relationship is non-linear and complex, and when there are many input features, including categorical features and missing values.

When comparing different regression models, it is important to evaluate their performance on a given data set using various metrics like, Mean Squared Error (MSE),Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) , R-squared (R2).

It is crucial to take into account ethical considerations when employing regression models. One of the main concerns is that the data used to train these models may contain inherent biases, leading to discriminatory or unjust outcomes. Furthermore, the outputs of these models must be analyzed with caution, as they may not present a comprehensive or precise representation of the actual data in the real world. Therefore, it is necessary to be mindful of ethical issues and to interpret the results of these models with care, in order to avoid undesirable consequences.
